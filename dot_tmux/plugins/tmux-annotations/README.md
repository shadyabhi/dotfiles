# tmux-annotations

Leave comments on your terminal scrollback.
Perfect for coding agent TUIs when you want to leave feedback on the huge plans agents come up with.

Select text in copy mode, attach a note to it, copy all of them to the clipboard and send it to your agent

## Usage

| Where | Key | Action |
|---|---|---|
| copy mode, with a selection | `i` | annotate the selection (floating input box) |
| anywhere | `prefix + a` | toggle the annotations overlay |
| overlay (or `prefix + Y`) | `Y` | copy **all** annotations to clipboard as markdown, then clear them |
| overlay | `j` / `k` / arrows | scroll |
| overlay | `d` | delete **all** annotations without copying (asks `y/n`) |
| overlay | `q` / `Esc` / `a` | close |

In the note input, `Enter` or `Cmd+Enter` saves and `Shift+Enter`
inserts a newline (Shift+Enter needs a terminal with extended-key
support — kitty CSI-u or xterm modifyOtherKeys — plus
`set -g extended-keys on` in tmux; `Alt+Enter` works everywhere).
`Esc` cancels.

Annotations are invisible until you toggle the overlay, so they never
cover your content. (tmux's scrollback is read-only and popups are modal,
so persistent in-place margin notes aren't possible — the overlay is the
closest tmux allows.)

While annotations exist, a count shows in the status bar (tmux 3.4+) —
click it to open the viewer. Disable with `set -g @annotations-status off`.

## Compatibility

- **tmux ≥ 3.2** (popups). On older tmux the keys explain the
  requirement instead of erroring; popup styling degrades gracefully
  on 3.2 (borders/titles need 3.3).
- **bash** anywhere in `$PATH` — works on macOS's stock bash 3.2 and
  modern bash alike. macOS, Linux, WSL, BSD.
- Fancy input keys (Shift+Enter, Cmd/Opt combos) light up on terminals
  with kitty-CSI-u or modifyOtherKeys support (kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm,
  foot, recent xterm — plus `set -g extended-keys on`); everywhere else
  the classic fallbacks (Alt+Enter, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+A/E…)
  cover the same operations.
- Non-UTF-8 locales get ASCII glyphs automatically.

## Install

### TPM

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'jnsahaj/tmux-annotations'
```

Then `prefix + I` to install.

### Manual

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jnsahaj/tmux-annotations ~/.tmux/tmux-annotations
```

```tmux
# in tmux.conf
run-shell ~/.tmux/tmux-annotations/annotations.tmux
```

## Configuration

All keybindings and the storage location are options (set them in
`tmux.conf` **before** the plugin loads; defaults shown):

```tmux
set -g @annotations-key 'i'          # annotate key (copy-mode table)
set -g @annotations-view-key 'a'     # toggle overlay (prefix table)
set -g @annotations-copy-key 'Y'     # copy all & clear (prefix table)
set -g @annotations-delete-key 'd'   # delete all, inside the overlay
set -g @annotations-status 'on'      # status-bar count indicator
set -g @annotations-dir '~/.local/share/tmux-annotations'
```

## Storage

Each annotation is a plain file in `<dir>/notes/<epoch>-<rand>.note`:
first line is your comment, the rest is the captured selection.
Delete a file to delete an annotation.
